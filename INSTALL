GNU AUTOTOOLS SUPPORT

This version of ABINIT includes full support for the GNU Autotools. If you
make changes to the source code and/or the documentation, you may need
recent test versions of GNU build tools to regenerate the intermediate
files (e.g. Makefile.am, Makefile.in, config.h.in).

The following versions were used to generate the intermediate files in
this distribution:

 * GNU Autoconf 2.69 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.69.tar.gz>

 * GNU Automake 1.15 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/automake-1.15.tar.gz>

 * GNU Libtool 2.2.4 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-2.2.4.tar.gz>

 * GNU M4 1.4 <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.4.tar.gz>

 * DocBook-utils 0.6.13 <http://sources.redhat.com/docbook-tools/>

Any question regarding the GNU Autotools support inside ABINIT should be
directed to Yann Pouillon <yann.pouillon@ehu.es>.
