          <p> Any kind of symmetries and corresponding sets of k-point can be input,
          and taken into account in the computation.
          <br/>Since ABINIT is based on periodic boundary conditions, the Brillouin
          zone must be sampled adequately. The number of k-points to be used
          for this sampling, in the full Brillouin zone, is inversely
          proportional to ucvol, but may also
          vary a lot from system to system. As a rule of thumb, a system
          with a large band gap will need few k-points, while metals will need
          lot of k-points to produce converged results.
          For large systems, the inverse scale with respect to ucvol
          is unfortunately stopped because at least one k-point must be
          used. The effective number of k-points to be used will be strongly
          influenced by the symmetries of the system, since only the
          irreducible part of the Brillouin zone must be sampled. Moreover
          the time-reversal symmetry (k equivalent to -k) can be used for
          ground-state calculations,
          to reduce sometimes even further the portion of the brillouin zone
          to be sampled. The number of k points to be used in a calculation
          is named nkpt. There is another way to take advantage of the
          time-reversal symmetry, in the specific case of k-points that are
          invariant under k => -k , or are sent to another vector distant
          of the original one by some vector of the reciprocal lattice.
          See below for more explanation about the advantages of using
          these k-points.

          <br/>As a rule of thumb, for homogeneous systems, a reasonable accuracy may be
          reached when the product of the number of atoms by the number of k-points
          in the full Brillouin zone is on the order of 50 or larger, for wide gap
          insulators, on the order of 250 for small gap semiconductors like Si,
          and beyond 500 for metals, depending on the value of the input variable
          tsmear. As soon as there is some vacuum in the system, the product
          natom * nkpt can be much smaller than this (for an isolated molecule
          in a sufficiently large supercell, one k-point is enough).

          <br/>The generation of special k point sets (Monkhorst-Pack sets)
          and band structure k points can be done directly inside ABINIT.
          A list of interesting k point sets, can be generated automatically,
          including a measure of their accuracy in term of integration
          within the Brillouin Zone.
