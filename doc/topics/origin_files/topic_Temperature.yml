    introduction : |- 

       <p>Density-Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) allows one to address a large variety of physical observables. Many properties of interest can be computed directly from the derivatives of the energy, without the use of finite differences: phonons modes, elastic tensors, effective charges, dielectric tensors, etc... 
       <p>A DFPT calculation workflow is conducted as follows:
       <li> Run a Ground-State calculation in order to extract the Kohn-Sham pseudo wave-functions; these must be extremely well converged.</li>

       <li>If necessary, e.g., for the application of the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to an electric field, determine the derivatives of the wave functions with respect to the wave vector <b>k</b>, and keep them in a file. The keyword [[rfddk]] is used to perform this type of calculation.</li>

       <li>Compute the 2nd-order derivative matrix (i.e., 2nd derivatives of the energy with respect to different perturbations &lambda;). This can be done thanks to the keywords [[rfphon]] (&lambda;=atomic displacement), [[rfstrs]] (&lambda;=strain), [[rfelfd]] (&lambda;=electric field) or [[rfmagn]] (&lambda;=magnetic field). </li>

       <li>Launch the anaddb tool (distributed with ABINIT) to analyse the derivative database and compute relaxed tensors and thermodynamical properties.</li>

       <p>Note that for PAW calculation, when performing the post-processing with anaddb, it is recommended to include all the keywords enforcing the sum rules (acoustic sum and charge neutrality). Indeed the PAW formalism involves, for each atom, the calculation of a large number of real space integrals, whose numerical effect may be to break the translational invariance.

       <p>Thanks to the locality provided by PAW partial wave basis, it is possible to perform response function calculations for correlated electron materials. The LDA+U formalism is usable without any restriction for the PAW+DFPT calculations.

       <p> All the tutorials dedicated to response functions can be followed both with norm-conserving pseudopotentials and with PAW atomic datasets.
       <p> More detailed explanations to perform a response calculation are given in the <a href="../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html">help_respfn </a>file.

       <li><a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_rf1.html">The lesson Response-Function 1 (RF1)</a>
       presents the basics of response-functions within ABINIT. The example
       given is the study of dynamical and dielectric properties of AlAs (an
       insulator): phonons at Gamma, dielectric constant, Born effective
       charges, LO-TO splitting, phonons in the whole Brillouin zone. The
       creation of the "Derivative Data Base" (DDB) is presented.</li>
       <li><a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_rf2.html">The lesson Response-Function 2 (RF2)</a>
       presents the analysis of the DDBs that have been introduced in the
       preceeding lesson RF1.  The computation of the interatomic forces and
       the computation of thermodynamical properties is an outcome of this
       lesson.</li>
       <li>The additional information given by lesson RF1 opens the door to
       <a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_optic.html">The lesson on Optic</a>, the utility that
       allows to obtain the frequency dependent linear optical dielectric
       function and the frequency dependent second order nonlinear optical
       susceptibility, in the simple "Sum-Over-State" approximation.</li>
       <li><a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_elastic.html">The lesson on the elastic
       properties</a> presents the computation with respect to the strain
       perturbation and its responses: elastic constants,
       piezoelectricity.</li>
       <li><a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_paral_dfpt.html">Parallelism of response-function
       calculations</a> - you need to be familiarized with the calculation of
       linear-response properties within ABINIT, see the tutorial <a
