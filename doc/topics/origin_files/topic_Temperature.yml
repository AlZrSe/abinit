    introduction : |- 
       <p>When the phonon band structure and corresponding eigenvectors are known over the whole Brillouin Zone, thanks fo Fourier interpolation (see [[topic:PhononBands]]),
       integrals can be performed, allowing to obtain a wealth of properties, like free energy, entropy, specific heat, as well as atomic temperature factors.
       On can see applications of this technique in [[Lee1995]].
       <p>Moreover, knowing such information for different volumes allows one to compute the thermal expansion, see [[gruns_ddbs]].
       <p>The input variables needed to perform the interpolation over the Brillouin Zone are described in [[topic_PhononBands]] and are not listed again in the present topic.

       presents the analysis of the DDBs that have been introduced in the
       preceeding lesson RF1.  The computation of the interatomic forces and
       the computation of thermodynamical properties is an outcome of this
       lesson.</li>
