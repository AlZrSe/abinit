    introduction : |- 
      There are two mechanisms to put constraints on the atom positions in ABINIT. They can be used in 
      [[topic:GeoOpt|geometry optimization]],
      [[topic:MolecularDynamics|molecular dynamics]] (including PIMD) 
      or other geometry algorithms (e.g. [[topic:TransPath|transition path searches]]).
      <p>The simplest one (entry point [[iatfix]]) simply define a set of atoms that are fixed, 
      either entirely, or only along one of the directions (for the latter, see the warning in [[iatfix]])
      <p>A more complex one, but also much more powerful, allows to place constraints on linear combinations of atomic positions.
      Thanks to such constraint, the mean position of two atoms (or a fragment, like a molecule) can be fixed, 
      or constrained to stay within an arbitrary plane. One can thus also sample different mean positions.
      See a complete description in [[wtatcon]].
