    introduction : |- 
         <p>In the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation framework, the correlation energy of an electronic system can
         be related to the density-density correlation function, also known as the reducible polarizability.
         When further neglecting the exchange-correlation contribution to the polarizability,
         one obtains the celebrated random-phase approximation (RPA) correlation energy.
         This expression for the correlation energy can alternatively be derived from many-body perturbation theory.
         In this context, the RPA correlation energy corresponds to the GW total energy.


         <p>The RPA correlation energy can be expressed as an integral function of the dielectric matrix (see [[cite:Gonze2016]]).
         The integral over the frequencies is performed along the imaginary axis, where the integrand function is very smooth.
         Only a few sampling frequencies are then necessary.
         In ABINIT, the RPA correlation energy is triggered by setting the keyword [[gwrpacorr]] to 1. 
         <p>The RPA correlation energy is a post-processed quantity
         from the GW module of ABINIT, which takes care of evaluating the dielectric matrix for several imaginary frequencies.

         <p>The RPA correlation has been shown to capture the weak van der Waals interactions [[cite:Lebegue2010]]
         and to drastically improve defect formation energies [[cite:Bruneval2012]].
         <p>The convergence versus empty states and energy cutoff is generally very slow.
         <p>It requires a careful convergence study. 
         The situation can be improved with the use of an extrapolation scheme ([[cite:Bruneval2008]], [[cite:Harl2010]]).
