    introduction : |
      The major factors governing the speed of an ABINIT run, for a given physical system, 
      are:  
      <ul>
        <li>the size of the planewave basis set , see [[topic_Planewaves]];</li> 
        <li>the size of the wavevector grid sampling, see [[topic_k-points]];</li> 
        <li>and the parallelism, see [[topic_parallelism]].</li>
      </ul>
      For the two first factors, there is a trade-off between CPU time and precision of the computation,
      while for the third factor, there is some limit on the maximal speed-up that can be achieved (and also, 
      the resources must be available.
      <p>Beyond these major factors, there is still room for some adjustment. The needed planewave basis set
      will depend on the pseudopotential (or PAW atomic dataset) that is used. Some might be softer than others 
      and need a smaller planewave basis set. They might possibly be less accurate as well ...
      <p>If one is only interested in ground-state properties and forces, one might also get some speed up by
      using a real-space representation of density and potential on a real space FFT grid that does not allow their
      fine details to be taken into account (actually, filtering such quantities). This is achieved by
      lowering [[boxcutmin]] below its theoretically needed value of 2.0 .
      <p>The choice of the FFT algorithm implementation, see [[fftalg]] might also lead to significant speed up, 
      on specific machines.
      <p>For specific k-points, time-reversal symmetry can be used to represent the wavefunctions with their 
      real part, instead of both their real and complex parts. This allows halving the memory needs, as well as
      the CPU time. See [[istwfk]].
      <p>Other input variables related to tuning the speed or the memory usage are for expert users only.
