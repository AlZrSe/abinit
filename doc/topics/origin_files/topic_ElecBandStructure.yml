    introduction : |
      The eigenenergies along a set of segments can be computed (non-self-consistent calculations [[iscf]]=-2)
      using a negative value of [[kptopt]], 
      with [[kptbounds]] defining the end points of the segments, and [[ndivsm]] (or [[ndivk]]) defining the 
      sampling. 
      <p>A band structure can even be represented using weights proportional to the orbital content (so-called "Fat Bands"),
      in case of PAW calculation, see [[pawfatbnd]], and related variables.
      <p>Different interpolation schemes for the band energies can be defined thanks to [[einterp]].
