    introduction : |
      The eigenenergies along a set of segments can be computed (non-self-consistent calculations [[iscf]]=-2)
      using a negative value of [[kptopt]], 
      with [[kptbounds]] defining the end points of the segments, and [[ndivsm]] (or [[ndivk]]) defining the 
      sampling. 
      <p>A band structure can even be represented using weights proportional to the orbital content (so-called "Fat Bands"),
      in case of PAW calculation, see [[pawfatbnd]], and related variables.
      <p>Different interpolation schemes for the band energies can be defined thanks to [[einterp]]. 
      The Wannier interpolation is also available through the use of the [[lesson:wannier90]] post-processor.
      <p>The band structure from a supercell calculation can be unfolded to the (large) Brillouin zone of the (small) primitive cell 
      thanks to the [[help:fold2bloch]] post-processor. See the related [[topic_Unfolding]].
      <p>Different plotting postprocessors exist to produce graphical representations of electronic band structures from ABINIT. The most 
      powerful is based on [[topic:Abipy]]. Simpler tools also exist, and can be found in ~abinit/scripts/post_processing
