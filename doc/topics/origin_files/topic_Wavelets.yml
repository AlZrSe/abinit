    introduction : |- 
         <p> A wavelet basis (instead of a plane wave basis) can be used in ABINIT.
         With a wavelet basis, one can perform basic static DFT calculations 
         with selected norm-conserving pseudopotentials (HGH or GTH pseudopotentials [[Genovese2008]]), 
         but also with PAW atomic data [[Rangel2016]]).
         Available also : the finite size corrections to the
         total energy, restart on wavefunctions following the ETSF norm and geometry
         relaxation using BFGS. Molecular dynamic is also available for test purposes.
         <p>However, DFPT or excited-state calculations (except &Delta;-SCF) cannot be performed.

          presents the parallelism of ABINIT, when wavelets are used as a basis function instead of planewaves, for
          the computation of total energy, density, and ground state properties</li>
