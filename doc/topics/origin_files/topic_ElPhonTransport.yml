        Warning : this topic concerns metals only.
        <p>The calculation of bulk transport quantities (electrical and thermal
        resistivities - the part that is determined by the electron-phonon interaction) is possible using anaddb. 
        Analogous quantities are obtained from the conducti post-processor, but due to electron-electron
        scattering, instead of electron-phonon.
        <p>A preliminary calculation of the derivatives of the wavefunctions with respect to
        k-vector must be carried out. After generating a GKK file (see [[topic:ElPhonInt]]), 
        the Electron-Phonon Coupling (EPC) analysis is performed in anaddb, setting [[anaddb:elphflag]] variable to 1. 
        Most of the procedure is automatic, but can be lengthy if a large number of k-points is being used. 
        <p>For the superconductivity calculations, The electron-phonon interaction is interpolated in reciprocal space,
        then integrated over the Fermi surface to give the Eliashberg function. 
        Several quadrature methods are available. 
        The default ([[anaddb:telphint]]=1) is to use Gaussian weighting,
        with a width [[anaddb:elphsmear]]. Another option is the improved
        tetrahedron [[cite:Bloechl1994a]] ([[anaddb:telphint]]=0).
        Finally ([[anaddb:telphint]]=2), one can integrate a given set of electron bands,
        between [[anaddb:ep_b_max]] and [[anaddb:ep_b_min]].
        The resulting integrated quantities are the Eliashberg function (in a file
        suffixed _A2F), and the EPC strength &lambda;
        which is printed in the main output file.
        <p>
        The transport calculation is turned on by setting
        [[anaddb:ifltransport]] to 1 in anaddb. The transport quantities depend on
        the Fermi velocity for each band, and the electronic band-dependence of the
        matrix elements must be
        preserved before integration, by setting [[anaddb:ep_keepbands]] to 1.
        This increases the memory used,
        by the square of the number of bands crossing E<sub>F</sub>. The results are the
        transport Eliashberg function (in file _A2F_TR), the
        electrical resistivity (in file _RHO), and the thermal
        conductivity (in file _WTH).

        <p>It is also possible to consider the temperature dependence of the Fermi energy: cubic spline interpolation ([[anaddb:ep_nspline]]) enables to linearly interpolate the transport arrays and reduce the memory usage. Besides setting the Fermi level with [[anaddb:elph_fermie]] (in Hartree), it is also possible to specify the extra electrons per unit cell, (i.e., the doping concentration often expressed in cm<sup>-3</sup>)  with [[anaddb:ep_extrael]].
        <p>Some details about the calculation of electron-phonon quantities in ABINIT and ANADDB can be found [[pdf:elphon_manual|here]].
