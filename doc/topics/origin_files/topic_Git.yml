    introduction : |
      ABINIT is developed under the control of [[https://git-scm.com/|git]], a well-known Version Control System.
      There is an official [[https://github.com/abinit/abinit|github mirror]] of the Abinit repository. 
      We welcome bug fixes and improvements. 
      Note that most of the active developments are hosted on the [[https://gitlab.abinit.org/|Gitlab server]]. 
      Before embarking on making significant changes, please contact the Abinit group. 
      <p>
      See [[https://github.com/abinit|the many different projects linked to ABINIT on Github]], actually gathered in the
      Github ABINIT organization.
