    introduction : |- 
         <p> The lifetime of positrons and their annihilation rate can be computed,
         using the self-consistent two-component DFT, including force and stress computation,
         LDA and GGA, norm-conserving as well as PAW [[Wiktor2015]].
         Doppler broadening can also be computed.
         The details of of the way to perform such calculations is given in the description of the [[positron]] input variable.
         <p> Examples can be found in [[Wiktor2013]],[[Wiktor2014]],[[Wiktor2014a]] and [[Wiktor2014b]].
