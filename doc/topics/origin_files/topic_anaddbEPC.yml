    introduction : |- 
        <p>The main Electron-Phonon Coupling (EPC) analysis is performed in anaddb, setting [[anaddb:elphflag]]
        variable to 1. Most of the procedure is automatic, but can be
        lengthy if a large number of k-points is being used. The [[anaddb:nqpath]] and
        [[anaddb:qpath]] variables must be set, specifying a path in reciprocal space.
        anaddb generates files containing the
        phonon linewidths (suffixed _LWD) and frequencies &omega;<sub>qj</sub> (suffixed _BST)
        along [[anaddb:qpath]]. One can calculate the nesting function n(q) =
        &sum;<sub>kii'</sub> &delta;(&epsilon;<sub>k,i</sub>) &delta;(&epsilon;<sub>k+q,i'</sub>) by
        setting [[anaddb:prtnest]] to 1 (output to _NEST).

        <p>After interpolation, the quantities must be integrated over the Fermi
        surface. Several quadrature methods are available. The default ([[anaddb:telphint]]=1) is to use Gaussian weighting,
        with a width [[anaddb:elphsmear]]. Another option is the improved
        tetrahedron [[Bloechl1994a]] ([[anaddb:telphint]]=0).
        Finally ([[anaddb:telphint]]=2), one can integrate a given set of electron bands,
        between [[anaddb:ep_b_max]] and [[anaddb:ep_b_min]].
        The resulting integrated quantities are the Eliashberg function (in a file
        suffixed _A2F), and the EPC strength &lambda;
        which is printed in the main output file.

        <p>The calculation of bulk transport quantities (electrical and thermal
        conductivities) is possible using anaddb. Analogous quantities are
        obtained from the conducti post-processor, but due to electron-electron
        scattering, instead of electron-phonon. A
        preliminary calculation of the derivatives of the wavefunctions with respect to
        k-vector must be carried out. The transport calculation is turned on by setting
        [[anaddb:ifltransport]] to 1 in anaddb. The transport quantities depend on
        the Fermi velocity for each band, and the electronic band-dependence of the
        matrix elements must be
        preserved before integration, by setting [[anaddb:ep_keepbands]] to 1.
        This increases the memory used,
        by the square of the number of bands crossing E<sub>F</sub>. The results are the
        transport Eliashberg function (in file _A2F_TR), the
        electrical resistivity (in file _RHO), and the thermal
        conductivity (in file _WTH).

        <p>It is also possible to consider the temperature dependence of the Fermi energy: cubic spline interpolation ([[anaddb:ep_nspline]]) enables to linearly interpolate the transport arrays and reduce the memory usage. Besides setting the Fermi level with [[anaddb:elph_fermie]] (in Hartree), it is also possible to specify the extra electrons per unit cell, (i.e., the doping concentration often expressed in cm<sup>-3</sup>)  with [[anaddb:ep_extrael]].
