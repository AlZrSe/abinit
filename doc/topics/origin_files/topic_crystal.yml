    introduction : |- 
         In addition to the [[topic:UnitCell|Specification of the unit cell]] and [[topic:AtomTypes|Atom types]], ABINIT must know
         the number of atoms inside the cell, their type, and position. 
         This is described by [[natom]], [[typat]] and one of [[xred]], [[xcart]] and [[xangst]].
         <p>
         ABINIT can automatically detect the Bravais lattice and space group,
         and generate symmetries (e.g. [[nsym]],[[symrel]],[[tnons]]), 
         from the primitive cell and the position of atoms (provided they are not too inaccurate, see [[tolsym]]). 
         For this purpose, in the magnetic case, ABINIT will also take into account the input atomic spin, through 
         the knowledge of [[spinat]].
         <p>
         Alternatively, ABINIT can start from the specification of symmetries (either from [[spgroup]] or from the
         list of symmetries - [[nsym]],[[symrel]],[[tnons]]) 
         and generate the atomic positions from the asymmetric (irreducible) 
         part of the primitive cell. This is described in the [[topic:SmartSymm|Smart Symmetrizer]] topic.
         <p>ABINIT can treat antiferromagnetic symmetry operations, see [[symafm]].
         <p>
         In ABINIT, a database with the 230 spatial groups of symmetry (see [[spgroup]]) 
         and the 1191 Shubnikov anti-ferromagnetic space groups is present (see also [[spgroupma]] and [[genafm]]).
         <p>There is also a (non-graphical) atom manipulator in ABINIT, see [[topic:AtomManipulator]].
         <p>ABINIT can read XYZ files, see [[xyzfile]].
         <p>Atomic positions can also be generated at random, see [[random_atpos]].
         <p>Details about the way the crystal structure is defined in ABINIT can be found <a href="../documents/geometry.pdf">here</a>.
