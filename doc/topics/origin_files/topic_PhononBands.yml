    introduction : |- 
       The Fourier transformation of the phonon dynamical matrices generates interatomic force constants in real space,
       as explained in [[Gonze1997a]]. Backtransforming to reciprocal space gives the Fourier interpolation
       of the initial phonon band structure. After such Fourier interpolation, the DOS can be produced (see [[Lee1995]]),
       the phonon eigenenergies plotted along lines, the slope of the energy versus cristalline momentum evaluated (to give sound velocity).

       presents the analysis of the DDBs that have been introduced in the
       [[lesson_rf1]].  The computation of the interatomic forces and
       the computation of thermodynamical properties is an outcome of this
       lesson.</li>
