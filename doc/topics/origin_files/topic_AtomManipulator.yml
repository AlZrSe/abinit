    introduction : |- 
         ABINIT has some (non-graphical) capabilities to manipulate atoms and group of atoms, to help establishing
         the set of atomic positions in the input file when big cells are considered.
         <p>
         Explicitly, one or two groups of atoms, forming e.g. a molecule, a cluster, or a small primitive cell, 
         can be repeated in arbitrary number, then translated and rotated. 
         Then, atoms can be removed, to form e.g. vacancies. See [[nobj]] as entry point.
         <p>
         The related input variables being used for preprocessing of the input file, they are not echoed
         in the output file ([[INPUT_ONLY]] characteristics).
