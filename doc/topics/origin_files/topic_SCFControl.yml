    introduction : |
      <p> The numerical precision of the calculations depends on many settings,
         among which the precision in solving the Kohn-Sham self-consistent equation.
      <p> Several parameters govern the SCF loop. The maximum number of cycles is given by [[nstep]],
         but the iterative procedure might be stopped earlier, as soon as the criterion chosen by the user
         is fulfilled. The user is asked to give a tolerance on some measure of the convergence. 
         The user must choose among [[toldfe]], [[toldff]], [[tolrff]], [[tolvrs]] and [[tolwfr]].
         <ul>
          <li>The most theoretically justified for the density/potential self-consistency is [[tolvrs]].</li> 
          <li>[[tolwfr]] is interesting for non-self-consistent calculations.</li> 
          <li>For molecular dynamics (which rely on the accuracy of forces), one might prefer [[tolrff]].</li>
         </ul>
      <p> Some input variables relate to the solution of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation. However, usually
         the related iterative techniques are well-tuned, so that these input variables ([[nline]] and [[tolrde]])
         are usually used only by experts. However, in cases where the convergence is difficult, it might be interesting
         to test improving them, as well as modifying [[nnsclo]].
      <p> The [[accuracy]] variable enables to tune the accuracy of a calculation by setting automatically up to seventeen variables.
