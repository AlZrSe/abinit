    introduction : |- 
       In the contour deformation technique, and other cases, one has to define a set of frequencies on which different numerical operations
       will be performed (computation of susceptibility matrices, integration along the real+imaginary axes).
       In the present topic, the input variables connected to such definitions are gathered.

       <li><a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_gw2.html">The second lesson on GW (GW2)</a> deals with
       the computation of the quasi-particle band structure of Aluminum, in
       the GW approximation (so, much better than the Kohn-Sham LDA band
       structure) without using the plasmon-pole model. </li>
