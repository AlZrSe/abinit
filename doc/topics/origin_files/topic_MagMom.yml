         <p>A complementary magnetic constraint method has been implemented in the ABINIT code, wherein the magnetization around each atom is pushed to a desired (vectorial) value. The constraint can either be on the full vector quantity, $\vec{m}$, or only on the direction <b>m</b>.  This is mainly useful for non collinear systems, where the direction and amplitude of the magnetic moment can change. The method follows that used in the Quantum Espresso [[cite:Moscaconte2007]] and VASP [[cite:Ma2015]] codes: a Lagrangian constraint is applied to the energy, and works through a resulting term in the potential, which acts on the different spin components. The magnetization in a sphere &Omega;<sub>i</sub> around atom i at position <b>R</b><sub>i</sub> is calculated as:
         <p><b>m</b> =&int;<sub>&Omega;<sub>i</sub></sub> <b>m</b>(<b>r</b>) d<b>r</b>

         <p>and the corresponding potential for spin component &alpha; is written as:

         <p>V<sub>&alpha;</sub> = 2 &lambda; f(| <b>r</b>-<b>R</b><sub>i</sub>| / r<sub>s</sub>) <b>c</b><sub>&alpha;</sub>

         <p>The function f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>(3+x(1+x(-6+3x))), is applied to smooth the transition near the edge of the sphere around <b>R</b><sub>i</sub>, over a thickness r<sub>s</sub> (by default 0.05 bohr, and f is set to 0 for | <b>r</b>-<b>R</b><sub>i</sub>|> r<sub>s</sub>). This minimizes discontinuous variations of the potential from iteration to iteration.

         <p>The constraint is managed by the keyword [[magconon]]. Value 1 gives a constraint on the direction (<b>c</b> = <b>m</b> - <b>s</b><sub>i</sub> (<b>s</b><sub>i</sub>.<b>m</b>), value 2 gives a full constraint on the vector (<b>c</b> = <b>m</b> - <b>s</b><sub>i</sub>), with respect to the keyword [[spinat]] (<b>s</b><sub>i</sub> above), giving a 3-vector for each atom. The latter is quite a stringent constraint, and often may not converge. The former value usually works, provided sufficient precision is given for the calculation of the magnetic moment (kinetic energy cutoff in particular).

         <p>The strength of the constraint is given by the keyword [[magcon_lambda]] (&lambda; above - real valued). Typical values are 10<sup>-2</sup> but vary strongly with system type: this value should be started small (here the constraint may not be enforced fully) and increased. A too large value leads to oscillations of the magnetization (the equivalent of charge sloshing) which do not converge.  A corresponding Lagrange penalty term is added to the total energy, and is printed to the log file, along with the effective magnetic field being applied. In an ideal case the energy penalty term should go to 0 (the constraint is fully satisfied).
