    introduction : |- 
        <p>ABINIT can treat charged systems (e.g. either for molecules, or for dopants in a supercell), 
        using the [[charge]] input variable. A careful convergence study with respect to the cell size must however be done.
        <p>Depending on the dimension, different treatment of the Coulomb interaction can be enforced, governed by [[icoulomb]] and [[icutcoul]] for GW calculations. Some development effort is needed in ABINIT to rationalize the situation.

        <p>Additional information concerning [[usepotzero]]. It is well known that the electrostatic potential (arising from ion-ion, ion-electron, and electron-electron interactions) is ill-defined within periodic boundary conditions.
        However, it is less well known that the total energy of a charged cell is also ill-defined.
        In fact, after a careful derivation in [[Bruneval2014]], it was shown that the above two statements are tightly linked:
        when the number of electrons differs from the number of protons in a cell, the necessary compensating background that enforces the overall charge neutrality
        is sensitive to the arbitrary average electrostatic potential.

        <p>ABINIT offers the possibility to choose which convention to use for the average electrostatic potential with the keyword [[usepotzero]].
        <p>In PAW, one can choose among 3 options:
        <li>the average of smooth electrostatic potential is set to zero;</li>
        <li>the average of all-electron electrostatic potential is set to zero;</li>
        <li>the average of smooth electrostatic potential is set to a finite value, which follows the Quantum Espresso implementation (see [[Giannozzi2009]] for more details).</li>

        <p>Only options 1 and 3 are valid for the NCPP case.

        <p>None of these conventions is intrinsically more correct than the other ones. This is just an arbitrary choice, but ABINIT now permits a straight comparison to the other codes.
