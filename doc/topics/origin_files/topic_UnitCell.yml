    introduction : |- 
         An initial set of three vectors, specified in real space by [[rprim]] or as unit vectors with angles [[angdeg]],
         are renormalized afterwards using scaling factors as specified by [[acell]] or by rescaling their cartesian coordinates, 
         as specified by [[scalecart]]. Internally, only the final result, [[rprimd]] matters.
         THe more detailed explanation can be found by looking at [[rprim]].

         <br>Details about the way the real space lattice, the reciprocal lattice, and symmetries are defined in ABINIT can be found <a href="../documents/geometry.pdf">here</a>.
