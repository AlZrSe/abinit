        <p>Because the PAW formalism provides a robust way to reconstruct the all-electron wavefunctions in
        the valence space, it is suitable for computing expectation values of
        observables localized even very close to the nuclei. Obtaining equivalent
        accuracy within the norm-conserving pseudopotential framework would require
        very small atomic radii for the pseudization procedure, and concomitantly
        high planewave cutoff energies and lengthy calculations. There remains
        the question of whether even all-electron accuracy in the valence space is
        sufficient for accurate representation of observables close to the nuclei,
        where conventional wisdom would suggest that deep core polarizations might
        be quite significant for properties such as the electric field gradient
        or Fermi contact interaction. Such concerns turn out to be unwarranted,
        however, as our experience and others have shown that the PAW formalism
        together with a typical chemical valence/core separation are sufficient
        for accurate description of nuclear point properties such as the electric
        field gradient [[Petrilli1998]],[[Profeta2003]],[[Zwanziger2008]], 
        Fermi contact interaction [[Zwanziger2009]] and magnetic chemical
        shielding [[Pickard2001]].

        <p>Both the electric field gradient and Fermi contact interaction are
        ground-state observables, and their computation adds negligible time to
        a normal self-consistent ground state calculation. The total charge density in the PAW
        formalism contains the pseudovalence density, the nuclear ionic charges,
        and the all-electron and pseudo charge densities within the PAW spheres.
        As done in earlier work, the electric field gradient due to the pseudovalence
        density is computed in reciprocal space, and the gradient due to the
        (fixed) ionic charges is computed with an Ewald sum approach. The PAW
        sphere charge densities contribute matrix elements of (3x<sub>&alpha;</sub> x<sub>&beta;</sub>
        -r<sup>2</sup>&delta;<sub>&alpha;&beta;</sub>)/r<sup>5</sup>, weighted by the charge densities in each
        channel determined by the self-consistent minimization procedure. This
        treatment [[Zwanziger2008]] is more flexible than for example assuming
        all bands are doubly occupied, and permits the current approach to be used
        with more complex electronic and magnetic states than just insulators.

        <p>Within ABINIT, the electric field gradient computation is invoked with
        the key word [[prtefg]] (for Print EFG), together with the key word [[quadmom]].
        The [[prtefg]] key word takes the values 1--3. For value 1, the electric field
        gradient coupling in MHz is reported, where the conversion is made by atom by combining
        the gradient with the nuclear quadrupole moments supplied by [[quadmom]]. When [[prtefg]] is
        input as 2, the additional breakdown of the field gradient in terms of valence and on-site
        PAW terms is reported, along with the eigenvectors of the EFG matrix, so that 
        principal directions may be determined with respect to the crystal axes. Finally,
        [[prtefg]]=3 allows additional computation of a point-charge model of the gradient, 
        for comparison purposes. The point charges by atom are supplied through the additional
        variable [[ptcharge]].
        Detailed examples of the use of ABINIT to compute EFG's can be found in 
        [[Zwanziger2008]],[[Zwanziger2009a]]. 

        <p>The Fermi contact interaction, which is just the electron density evaluated
        precisely at the nuclear location, is an important component of the isomer
        shift measured in M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy. The isomer shift is directly
        proportional to n<sub>abs</sub>(<b>R</b>)-n<sub>src</sub>(<b>R</b>),
        the difference in electron density at the absorber (sample) and the
        source. Evaluating the density at a nuclear position can be accomplished
        by treating &delta;(<b>r</b>-<b>R</b>) as the observable, that is, the
        three-dimensional Dirac delta function centered on the nuclear position
        <b>R</b>. Because of the short-range nature of the delta function, in the
        PAW-transformed version of the observable only matrix elements of the on-site
        all-electron valence functions are required [[Zwanziger2009]], and these
        are evaluated from a linear fit to the first few points of the PAW radial
        functions.

        <p>Within ABINIT the Fermi contact interaction is invoked with the 
        key word [[prtfc]] (for Print Fermi Contact), which only takes the value 1.
        When called, the electron density at each nuclear position is reported, in atomic
        units (electrons per cubic Bohr). The isomer shift as measured in M&ouml;ssbauer
        spectroscopy is typically reported in velocity units and is obtained from the
        formula 

        <p>&delta; = (2&pi;cZe<sup>2</sup>/3E<sub>&gamma;</sub>)
        [n<sub>abs</sub>(<b>R</b>)-n<sub>src</sub>(<b>R</b>)] 
        &Delta;&lang;r<sup>2</sup>&rang;
        <p>where c is the speed of light, E<sub>&gamma;</sub> the &gamma;-ray energy, Z the atomic number,
        e the electron charge, and &Delta;&lang;r<sup>2</sup>&rang; the change in the mean square nuclear
        radius for the transition. The electronic densities n<sub>abs</sub> and n<sub>src</sub> refer 
        to the absorber and source respectively. Because of the linearity of this formula in the density
        at the absorber (sample) nucleus, the only unknown (&Delta;&lang;r<sup>2</sup>&rang;) can be obtained
        by comparing the calculated values in several standards to experiment and then the computations
        can be used to interpret the measurements of new materials. In [[Zwanziger2009]] 
        it is showed how to perform such studies on a variety of compounds.
