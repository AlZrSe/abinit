    introduction : |- 
         ABINIT needs to know the different types of atoms that form the system.
         <p>
         The atoms assembled in a molecule or a solid are usually entirely specified by their 
         nuclear charge (and their mass for dynamical properties). 
         <p>
         However, in a pseudopotential
         or PAW approach, the knowledge of the nuclear charge does not define the potential felt by the electron,
         only the atomic data (pseudopotential or PAW) defines it. Thus, in addition to the number of types
         of atoms [[ntypat]], and their nuclear charge [[znucl]],
         ABINIT requires to know the pseudopotential/PAW to use for each type of atom. 
         The latters are specified in the "files" file. Unless alchemical potentials are used (see later),
         the number of pseudopotentials to be read, [[npsp]], is the same as [[ntypat]].
         <br>More on the pseudos/PAW in [[topic:PseudosPAW]].
         <p>ABINIT also has a default table of the atomic masses, but this can be superceded by specifying [[amu]].
         <p><b>Alchemical potentials</b></p> 
         For norm-conserving pseudopotentials, ABINIT can mix the pseudopotentials, as described in [[TOBEPROVIDED]],
         to create so-called "alchemical potentials", see [[mixalch]].
         <br>In this case, the number of pseudopotentials to be given, [[npsp]], will usually be larger than the 
         number of types of atoms, [[ntypat]]. Using alchemical potentials makes sense to treat alloys in which
         similar ions are present, and whose specific chemical properties are not crucial for the property of interest.
         Usually it is done only for isovalent species, and ions of quite similar radii. It is a reasonable interpolation 
         technique for the electronic properties.
