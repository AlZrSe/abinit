    introduction : |-
      The computation of the ground state energy of an assembly of nuclei and electrons
      placed in a repeated cell can be done using (1) plane waves and norm-conserving
      pseudopotentials, or, (2) so-called "Projector-Augmented Waves" (PAW method), with appropriate pseudoatomic data,
      or (3) wavelets. The wavelet framework is described [[topic:Wavelets|here]].

      <br/>In the plane wave framework, the program admits many different types of pseudopotentials.
      There are several complete sets of norm-conserving pseudopotentials available for
      most elements of the periodic table. The recommended one (GGA) comes from the ONCVPSP generator (with spin-orbit coupling).
      For PAW calculation,the recommended one (GGA and LDA) is the JTH table in the PAW XML format. 
      The choice between norm-conserving pseudopotentials or PAW is 
      deduced automatically by the choice of the pseudopotential in the "files" file.
      An input file must specify the following items:
      the [[topic:crystal|crystalline structure and symmetries]].
      the set of [[topic:k-points|k-points]] used.
      the [[topic:xc|exchange and correlation functional]].
      the convergency settings.
      possibly [[topic:PAW|PAW]] special settings.
      possibly, input variables for [[topic:spinpolarisation|spin-polarized systems and spin orbit coupling]] calculations.
