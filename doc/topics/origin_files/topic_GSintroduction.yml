    introduction : |-
      The computation of the ground state energy of an assembly of nuclei and electrons
      placed in a repeated cell can be done using (1) plane waves and norm-conserving
      pseudopotentials, or, (2) so-called
      "Projector-Augmented Waves" (PAW method), with appropriate pseudoatomic data,
      or (3) wavelets. The wavelet framework is described <a href="topic_Wavelets.html">here</a>.

      <br/>In the plane wave framework, the program admits many different types of pseudopotentials.
      There are several complete sets of norm-conserving pseudopotentials available for
      most elements of the periodic table. The recommended one (GGA) comes from the ONCVPSP generator (with spin-orbit coupling).
      For PAW calculation,the recommended one (GGA and LDA) is the JTH table in the PAW XML format. 
      The choice between norm-conserving pseudopotentials or PAW is 
      deduced automatically by the choice of the pseudopotential in the "files" file.

      An input file must specify the following items:

      <p> 
      <br/>- the <a href="topic_crystal.html">crystalline structure and symmetries</a>.
      <br/>- the set of <a href="topic_k-points.html">k-points</a> used.
      <br/>- the <a href="topic_xc.html">exchange and correlation </a> functional.
      <br/>- <a href="topic_convergency.html">convergency settings </a>.
      <br/>- possibly, <a href="topic_PAW.html">PAW</a> special settings.
      <br/>- possibly, input variables for <a href="topic_spinpolarisation.html">
      spin-polarized systems and spin orbit coupling</a> calculations.
      <br/>- possibly, <a href="topic_otherGS.html">other</a> special settings.
