    introduction : |- 
        <p>DFT performs reasonably well for the determination of structural properties,
        but fails to predict accurate band gaps.
        A more rigorous framework for the description of excited states
        is provided by many-body perturbation theory (MBPT)  [[Fetter1971]],[[Abrikosov1975]], 
        based on the Green's functions
        formalism and the concept of quasi-particles [[Onida2002]].
        <p>Within MBPT, one can calculate the quasi-particle (QP) energies, E, and amplitudes, &Psi;, 
        by solving a nonlinear equation involving the non-Hermitian, nonlocal and frequency dependent self-energy operator &Sigma;.
        <p>This equation goes beyond the mean-field approximation of independent KS particles as
        it accounts for the dynamic many-body effects in the electron-electron interaction.
        <p>Details about the GW implementation in ABINIT can be found 
        [[theory:mbt|here]]
        <p>A typical GW calculation consists of two different steps (following a DFT calculation):
        first the screened interaction &epsilon;<sup>-1</sup> is calculated and stored on disk ([[optdriver]]=3), 
        then the KS band structure and W are used to evaluate the matrix elements of &Sigma;, 
        finally obtaining the QP corrections ([[optdriver]]=4). 
        <p>The computation of the screened interaction is described in [[topic_Susceptibility]], while the 
        computation of the self-energy is described in [[topic_SelfEnergy]]. The frequency meshes, used e.g. for 
        integration along the real and imaginary axes are described in [[topic_FrequencyMeshMBPT]].

        <li>[[lesson:gw1]] The first lesson on GW (GW1) deals with
        the computation of the quasi-particle band gap of Silicon 
        (semiconductor), in the GW approximation (much better than the
        Kohn-Sham LDA band structure), with a plasmon-pole model. </li>
        <li>[[lesson:gw2]] The second lesson on GW (GW2) deals with
        the computation of the quasi-particle band structure of Aluminum, in
        the GW approximation (so, much better than the Kohn-Sham LDA band
        structure) without using the plasmon-pole model. </li>
        <li>[[lesson:mbt|Parallelism of Many-Body Perturbation calculations (GW)]] allows to speed up the calculation of
        accurate electronic structures (quasi-particle band structure,
        including many-body effects).</li>
