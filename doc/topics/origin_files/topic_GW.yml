    introduction : |- 
        <p>DFT performs reasonably well for the determination of structural properties,
        but fails to predict accurate band gaps.
        A more rigorous framework for the description of excited states
        is provided by many-body perturbation theory (MBPT)  [[Fetter1971]],[[Abrikosov1975]], 
        based on the Green's functions
        formalism and the concept of quasi-particles [[Onida2002]].
        <p>Within MBPT, one can calculate the quasi-particle (QP) energies, E, and amplitudes, &Psi;, 
        by solving a nonlinear equation involving the non-Hermitian, nonlocal and frequency dependent self-energy operator &Sigma;.
        <p>This equation goes beyond the mean-field approximation of independent KS particles as
        it accounts for the dynamic many-body effects in the electron-electron interaction.
        <p>Details about the GW implementation in ABINIT can be found <a href="../../theory/generated_files/theorydoc_mbt.html">here</a>.
        <p>A typical GW calculation consists of two different steps (following a DFT calculation):
        first the screened interaction &epsilon;<sup>-1</sup> is calculated and stored on disk ([[optdriver]]=3), 
        then the KS band structure and W are used to evaluate the matrix elements of &Sigma;, 
        finally obtaining the QP corrections ([[optdriver]]=4). 
        <p>The computation of the screened interaction is described in [[topic_Susceptibility]], while the 
        computation of the self-energy is described in [[topic_SelfEnergy]].
