    introduction : |- 
         <p> The computation of the ground state energy of an assembly of nuclei and electrons
         placed in a repeated cell can be done using so-called
         "Projector-Augmented Waves" (PAW method), with appropriate pseudoatomic data. The way the PAW method is implemented in ABINIT is described in [[Torrent2008]].
         <br/> The use of PAW atomic data (equivalent to pseudopotential file for the norm-conserving case) automatically launch a PAW calculation. ABINIT is provided with the JTH [[Jollet2014]] PAW atomic data table on the ABINIT web site.
         <br/> To perform a standard PAW calculation, the input file is the same than for a norm-conserving one, except that the variable [[pawecutdg]] must be specified (see below). In the case the input variable [[accuracy]] is used, the input variable [[pawecutdg]] is automatically used.
         <br/> Some physical functionalities are available only in the PAW framework: DFT+U, DMFT, local exact exchange,...
