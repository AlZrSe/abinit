    introduction : |- 
         <p>The PAW atomic data can be used with plane waves as well as with wavelets. Specificities of PAW for use with planewaves
         are presented here. See [[topic:Wavelets]] for its use with wavelets.
         <p>The way the PAW method is implemented with planewaves in ABINIT is described in [[cite:Torrent2008]].
         <br/> The use of PAW atomic data (equivalent to pseudopotential file for the norm-conserving case) automatically launch a PAW calculation. ABINIT is provided with the JTH [[cite:Jollet2014]] PAW atomic data table on the ABINIT web site.
         <br/> To perform a standard PAW calculation, the input file is the same than for a norm-conserving one, except that the variable [[pawecutdg]] must be specified (see below). In the case the input variable [[accuracy]] is used, the input variable [[pawecutdg]] is automatically used.
         <br/> Some physical functionalities are available only in the PAW framework: DFT+U, DMFT, local exact exchange,...

            <li>The lesson on the use of PAW ([[lesson:paw1|PAW1]])
            presents the Projector-Augmented Wave method, implemented in ABINIT as
            an alternative to norm-conserving pseudopotentials, with a sizeable
            accuracy and CPU time advantage.</li>
            <li>The lesson on the generation of PAW atomic data files ([[lesson:paw2|PAW2]])  
            presents the generation of atomic data for use with the PAW method. Prerequisite: PAW1.</li>
            <li>The lesson on the validation of a PAW
            atomic datafile ([[lesson:paw3|PAW3]]) demonstrates how to test a generated PAW
            dataset using ABINIT, against the ELK all-electron code, for diamond
            and magnesium. Prerequisite: PAW1 and PAW2.</li>
