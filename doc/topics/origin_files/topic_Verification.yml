    introduction : |
      One can never be sure that an implementation of a complicated formalism is numerically correct.
      However, several studies have helped to gain confidence in selected properties computed within ABINIT, 
      by making detailed comparisons with independently developed software applications.
      <p> The ground state total energy, geometry relaxation, phonon frequencies, 
      electron-phonon matrix elements, temperature dependence of the electronic gap has been cross checked with Quantum Espresso and YAMBO. 
      See [[cite:Ponce2014]].
      <p> It is possible to choose the same convention for the definition of the average eletrostatic potential, than Quantum Espresso, 
      allowing verification of results for charged systems. See [[cite:Bruneval2014]].
      <p>See the "Validation" section in [[topic:PseudosPAW]].
