    introduction : |- 
      [[https://github.com/abinit/abipy|AbiPy]] is a Python library to analyze the results produced by ABINIT. 
      It also provides tools to generate input files and workflows to automate ab-initio calculations and typical convergence studies. 
      AbiPy is interfaced with Pymatgen and this allows users 
      to benefit from the different tools and python objects available in the pymatgen ecosystem.
      <p> AbiPy can be used in conjunction with matplotlib, pandas, ipython and jupyter 
      thus providing a powerful and user-friendly environment for data analysis and visualization. 
      Check out the list of plotting scripts available 
      in the [[http://pythonhosted.org/abipy/examples/plot/index.html|examples/plot]] gallery. 
      To learn more about the integration between jupyter and AbiPy, visit the collection of notebooks and the AbiPy lessons.
