    introduction : |- 
         <p> The numerical precision of the calculations depends on many settings, 
         among which the definition of a basis set is likely the most important. With planewaves, there
         is one single parameter, [[ecut]] that governs the completeness of the basis set. 
         <p> The wavefunction, density, potentials are represented in both reciprocal space (plane waves)
         and real space, on a homogeneous grid of points. The transformation from reciprocal space to real space and vice-versa
         is made thanks to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.
         With norm-conserving pseudopotential, [[ecut]] is also the main parameter to define the real space FFT grid,
         In PAW, the sampling for such quantities is governed by a more independent variable, [[pawecutdg]].
         More precise tuning might be done by using [[boxcutmin]] and [[ngfft]].
         <p> Avoiding discontinuity issues with changing the size of the planewave basis set is made possible thanks to [[ecutsm]].
         <p> The [[accuracy]] variable enables to tune the accuracy of a calculation by setting automatically up to seventeen variables.
         <p> For the similar settings related to wavelets, see [[topic:Wavelets]].
