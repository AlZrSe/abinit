    introduction : |- 
         <p> This feature is available only in PAW. The LDA-1/2 framework is described in
         [[Ferreira2008]]. In ABINIT, the LDA-1/2 approximation needs to use PAW data files that contain a small potential vminushalf that is added to the local potential inside the code.
         The LDA-1/2 approach is based on Slater's half occupation technique to restore the band gap of semi-conductors and insulators.
