    introduction : |- 

        <p>An applied external magnetic field has been implemented in ABINIT by considering the Zeeman spin response only (i.e., neglecting the orbital contribution).
        <p>Following the procedure of Bousquet et al.,[[Bousquet2011]] the applied <b>B</b> field is introduced by adding the "Zeeman term" term in the non-collinear Kohn-Sham potential:
        <p>This contribution is trivial to implement, and also dominant in amplitude, but has historically been neglected with respect to the orbital responses, which are rich in more complex physics. 
        <p>Unlike an applied electric field, such a Zeeman term in the potential is compatible with periodic boundary conditions. It is also compatible with collinear calculations by reducing its application on ``up'' and ``down'' spin channels with <b>B</b>=B<b>e</b><sub>z</sub>.
        <p>In ABINIT, the finite Zeeman field is controlled by the keyword [[zeemanfield]] which allows to control the amplitude of the applied <b>B</b>-field (in Tesla) along the three cartesian directions.
        <p>Such an applied Zeeman field allows one to calculate the spin contribution of the magnetic and magnetoelectric susceptibilities, and to observe phase transitions under finite magnetic field, if present.
