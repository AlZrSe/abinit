    introduction : |- 
       <p>In the independent-particle approximation, the frequency-dependent susceptibility matrix, and 
       related screened interaction matrix, and inverse dielectric matrix can be computed.
       <p>This can be done on top of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues obtained from Kohn-Sham, generalized Kohn-Sham (e.g. hybrid functionals),
       as well as self-consistent quasiparticle methodology in the (generalized) Kohn-Sham basis.
       <p>This is a prerequisite to many-body perturbation theory calculations, see [[topic_GW]] and [[topic_BSE]], to which we refer.
       <p>The frequency meshes, used e.g. for integration along the real and imaginary axes, on which the 
        susceptibility matrices (and related matrices) have to be computed are described in [[topic_FrequencyMeshMBPT]].
