    introduction : |-
      <br/>Metallic as well as insulating systems can be treated. Schemes for
      determination of the occupation number include the Fermi broadening,
      the Gaussian broadening, the Gaussian-Hermite broadening, as well as
      the modifications proposed by Marzari. Finite temperatures
      can also be treated using a smearing scheme (Verstraete scheme).
