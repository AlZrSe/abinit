    introduction : |-
      <br/>Metallic as well as insulating systems can be treated, depending on the
      value of [[occopt]]. The default value of [[occopt]] corresponds to an insulator (or finite molecule): 
      the number of bands (or states for a molecule) is deduced from the number of electrons brought
      by each pseudopotential ion, and then all the bands are occupied (by two electrons in case of a non-spin-polarized
      system, or by 1 electron in the cas of a spin-polarized system), and a small number of empty bands are added,
      e.g. to obtain the band gap. 
      <p>For a metallic system, use a value of [[occopt]] between 3 and 7. ABINIT will compute a default number
      of bands, including some nearly unoccupied ones, and find the occupation numbers.
      The different values of [[occopt]] correspond to different smearing schemes (smearning defined by [[tsmear]] 
      for defining the occupation
      numbers, e.g. Fermi broadening,
      the Gaussian broadening, the Gaussian-Hermite broadening, as well as
      the modifications proposed by Marzari. Finite temperatures
      can also be treated thanks to a smearing scheme (Verstraete scheme) using [[tphysel]].
      <p>It is possible to define manually the number of bands (input variable [[nband]]) as well as the
      occupation numbers (input variable [[occ]]). This might be useful to perform a &Delta;-SCF calculation
      for excited states.
