              <p>LDA+U as well as DFT+DMFT requires as input values the effective Coulomb interaction. Two ways to compute them are available in ABINIT.

              <p>Firstly, the constrained Random Phase Approximation [[Aryasetiawan2004]] [[ucrpa]] allows one to take into account 
              the screening of the Coulomb interaction between correlated electrons, by non-interacting electrons. For non-entangled bands ([[ucrpa]]= 1), the bands excluded from the polarisability
              can be specified either by a band index ([[ucrpa_bands]]) or an energy window ([[ucrpa_window]]) [[Amadon2014]].
              <p>For entangled bands ([[ucrpa]]= 2}), the scheme used in ABINIT [[Shih2012]],[[Sakuma2013]],[[Amadon2014]] uses a band and k-point dependent
              weight to define the polarisability, using Wannier orbitals as correlated orbitals.
              <p>This method is well adapted to compute the effective interaction for the same orbitals used in DFT+DMFT. To
              use the same orbitals as in DFT+U, the Wannier functions can be ajusted such that the bare interaction is close to the bare interaction of atomic orbitals as used in DFT+<i>U</i> (see tutorial).

              <p>Secondly, a linear response method [[Cococcioni2005]] is implemented. The implementation is not
              yet in production. The implementation in ABINIT takes into account the truncated atomic orbitals from PAW and therefore differs from the original work [[Cococcioni2005]] treating full atomic orbitals. In particular, considerably higher effective values for U are found.
