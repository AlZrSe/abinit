      <p> The input file must specify some general characteristics of the system under study: number of atoms, type of atoms, etc...
      <br/>Metallic as well as insulating systems can be treated. Schemes for
      determination of the occupation number include the Fermi broadening,
      the Gaussian broadening, the Gaussian-Hermite broadening, as well as
      the modifications proposed by Marzari. Finite temperatures
      can also be treated using a smearing scheme (Verstraete scheme).
      <p>
      <h4><b>Forces and stresses settings:</b></h4>
      <p>Hellman-Feynman forces are computed from an analytical formula,
      and corresponds exactly to the limit of finite differences of energy
      for infinitesimally small atomic displacements when the ground-state
      calculation is at convergence. This feature is available for all the
      cases where the total energy can be computed.
      A correction for non-converged
      cases allows to get accurate forces with less converged wavefunctions
      than without it. The decomposition of the forces in their different
      components can be provided.
      <p>
      Stress can also be computed. This feature is available for all
      the cases where the total energy can be computed (except wavelets).
      The decomposition of the stresses in their different
      components can be provided. A smearing scheme applied to the kinetic
      energy allows to get smooth energy curves as a function of
      lattice parameters and angles.
      <p> see basic input variables [[optforces]] and [[optstress]] and 
      useful variables [[strprecon]], [[strtarget]], [[toldff]], [[tolrff]].
