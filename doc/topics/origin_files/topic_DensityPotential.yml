    introduction : |- 
      <p>All the files that have the density and potential format, see [[topic_printing]] can be analyzed
      with the "Cut3D" postprocessor. In particular, it can produce two-dimensional cuts (or one-dimensional cuts) through the three-dimensional
      data, suitable for later visualisation using e.g. [[topic:Abipy]].
      It can perform the Hirshfeld computation of atomic charges. 
      It can analyse the charge contained in an atomic sphere, 
      and determine the angular momentum projected charge (l=0 to 4) contained in that sphere. 
      (only available for norm-conserving pseudopotentials) 
      <p>See the [[help:cut3d]], as well as the [[lesson:analysis_tools]].
