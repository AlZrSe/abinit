          Like the electronic wavefunctions, the collective atomic displacements
          that are eigenmodes of the corresponding periodic Hamiltonian
          can be characterized by a wavevector, denoted q-point.
          <p>In ABINIT, DFPT calculations for one dataset are done for one specific
          q-point, that must be specified. In the simplest case, the user gives
          the corresponding q-point for each dataset, setting [[nqpt]]=1 and specifying the corresponding single [[qpt]].
          However, very often, it is needed to run calculations for dozens or hundreds of
          q-points. Hence, the following mechanism has been set: the use can specify a set of q points,
          using input variables similar to the k-points, and then, for each dataset, the number of the 
          q-point in the set is indicated thanks to [[iqpt]]. This applies to the generation of q-point grids as well as to
          q-point paths to produce phonon band structures.
          <p>The input variables for specifying q-points in ANADDB are specified in [[topic:Phonons]] and [[topic:PhononBands]].
