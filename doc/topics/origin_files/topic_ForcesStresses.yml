    introduction : |-
      <p>Hellman-Feynman forces are computed from an analytical formula,
      and corresponds exactly to the limit of finite differences of energy
      for infinitesimally small atomic displacements when the ground-state
      calculation is at convergence. This feature is available for all the
      cases where the total energy can be computed.
      A correction for non-converged
      cases allows to get accurate forces with less converged wavefunctions
      than without it. The decomposition of the forces in their different
      components can be provided.
      <p>
      Stress can also be computed. This feature is available for all
      the cases where the total energy can be computed (except wavelets).
      The decomposition of the stresses in their different
      components can be provided. A smearing scheme applied to the kinetic
      energy [[ecutsm]] allows one to get smooth energy curves as a function of
      lattice parameters and angles. A target stress can be given by the user ([[strtarget]]), the
      geometry optimization algorithm will try to find the primitive cell and atomic positions
      that deliver that target stress.
      <p> The computation of forces and stresses is optional, see [[optforces]] and [[optstress]]. 
      They are used to define SCF stopping criteria ([[toldff]], [[tolrff]]) or geometry optimization
      stopping criteria ([[tolmxf]]). For the geometry optimization, combined cell shape and
      atomic position optimization need a conversion scale, set by [[strprecon]].
