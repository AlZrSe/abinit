       The Fock exchange term has been implemented in ABINIT, both in the norm-conserving pseudopotential framework and in the PAW one. 
       Some details about the implementation in ABINIT can be found <a href="../documents/hybrids-2017.pdf">here</a>.
       <br/> For an ABINIT user, to make a calculation of Fock exchange:
       <br/>- do a first GGA dataset for the ground state
       <br/>- do a second dataset for the Fock calculation choosing [[ixc]]=40-42 (HF, PBE0, PBE0-1/3), -402 (B3LYP-Libxc), -406 (PBE0-Libxc), -456 (PBE0-1/3 Libxc), or -427, -428 (HSE03, HSE06).
       <p>
       <br/>The energy, forces and stresses are available in the norm-conserving and PAW frameworks. 
       <br/>A one-shot G0W0 calculation can follow, only in the norm-conserving case at present.
       <p> WARNING:
       <br/> Use [[istwfk]]=1, [[iscf]]=2, [[paral_kgb]]=0, [[paral_atom]]=0.
       <br/> The efficiency of the calculation is not optimal. Work is in progress concerning this point.
