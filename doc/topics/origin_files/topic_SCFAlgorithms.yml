    introduction: |
      Self-Consistent Field calculations allow to determine the solution of the Kohn-Sham equations, ending with converged
      "self-consistent" wavefunctions, density, and Kohn-Sham potentials. Different algorithms can be chosen to converge
      to the solution of this set of equations, governed by the input variable [[iscf]] and [[wfoptalg]].
      [[iscf]] focuses on the density/potential self-consistency algorithms, while [[wfoptalg]] focuses on the
      determination of the wavefunction through the solution of the Shr&ouml;dinger equation with fixed Kohn-Sham potential.
      <p>
      The algorithm selected by [[iscf]] are the iterative kind, among which Pulay mixing is one of the most efficient.
      Also, an efficient preconditioner will speed up the convergence.
      Among different choices, a generalized Kerker preconditioner is implemented, see [[diemac]], [[diemix]] and [[dielng]].
      <br/>
      In order to perform a non-self-consistent calculations of wavefunctions and corresponding eigenvalues
      in a fixed potential, as for representing a full band structure, the loop over density/potentials self-consistency
      must be disabled, for which [[iscf]]=-2 must be chosen.
      <p>
      Among the algorithms to find the wavefunctions, selected by [[wfoptalg]], 
      the conjugate-gradient and the LOBPCG ones are the favourite. Use the Chebyshev filtering for massive parallel runs.
