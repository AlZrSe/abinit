    introduction: |
      Self-Consistent Field calculations allow to determine the solution of the Kohn-Sham equations, ending with converged
      "self-consistent" wavefunctions, density, and Kohn-Sham potentials. Different algorithms can be chosen to converge
      to the solution of this set of equations, governed by the input variable [[iscf]].
      The same [[iscf]] allows one also to choose to make non-self-consistent calculations of wavefunctions and corresponding eigenvalues
      in a fixed potential.
