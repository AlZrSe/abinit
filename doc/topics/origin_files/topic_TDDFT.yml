         <p> 
         For finite systems (atoms and molecules), excited states 
         can be computed within TDDFT (Casida approach - only norm-conserving
         pseudopotentials). See the explanations given in the [[lesson:tddft]] lesson of tutorial. The [[iscf]] input variable must be set to -1.
         <p>In the non-spin-polarized case, spin-singlet as well as spin-triplet excitations are computed. Spin-polarized case is also available.
