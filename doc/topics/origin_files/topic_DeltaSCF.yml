    introduction : | 
      Although formally not justified, difference in total energy using constrained occupation numbers
      sometimes results in surprisingly good agreement with experimental results, for neutral excitations,
      in molecules or doped solids. See e.g. [[cite:Jia2017]].
      <p>The manual specification of the occupation numbers is needed in this case. This is accomplished
      with the input variable [[occ]], coupled with [[occopt]]=0 for the homogeneous occupation of a band
      throughout the Brillouin Zone, or with [[occopt]]=2 for the specific occupation of a state for a selected k-wavevector.
      For very big cells, both should be equivalent, and [[occopt]]=0 is easier to use.
