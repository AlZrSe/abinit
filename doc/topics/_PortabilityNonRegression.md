## Introduction

ABINIT is tested at each merge in the trunk, on a dedicated test farm, see
[[http://dev.abinit.org/environment/buildbot/buildbot-slave-matrix]] and
[[http://dev.abinit.org/environment/buildbot/buildbot-builder-matrix]]. The
numerous tests contained in ~abinit/tests/doc are executed, and compared with
reference files.
