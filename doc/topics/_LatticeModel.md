This page gives hints on how to build a lattice model in multibinit.

## Introduction

The MULTIBINIT software is using a second-principles approach for lattice dynamics simulations based on atomic potentials fitted on first-principles calculations [[cite:Wojdel2013]].
The set up of a lattice model is the first step of the second-principles approach, see the tutorial below, for the harmonic part,
as well as further topics for the anharmonic part, [[topic:FitProcess | Topic for the fit process]] and [[topic:BoundProcess | Topic for the bound process]].
Then, one can run a dynamics, see [[topic:DynamicsMultibinit | Topic to run a dynamics]].

## Tutorials

The [[tutorial:lattice_model|First lesson on Multibinit]] explains how to build a lattice model and to run a dynamics.
