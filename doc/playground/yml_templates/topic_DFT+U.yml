    introduction : |- 
         <p> This feature is available only in PAW. The DFT+U framework is described in
         the paper [1] and [2]. In ABINIT, the DFT+U approximation is implemented inside the PAW atomic spheres only.
         Two choices of double counting are provided: the Full Localized limit
         and the Around Mean Field approximation.
         Our implementation is described in [5].
         It follows the main lines of the paper [4].
         Forces and stress are implemented.
         For details on keywords 
         ([[lpawu]],[[upawu]],[[jpawu]],[[usedmatpu]],[[dmatpuopt]],[[dmatudiag]]) 
         see keyword [[usepawu]] in input variables.

         <p> In both the output and log files, we can find:
         <p>- The DFT+U contribution of energy which is contained inside the PAW Spherical terms in the output file.
         <p>- The Decomposition of the LDA+U energy is given (Interaction energy, Double
           counting term, and sum of the two) in the log file.
         <p>- The orbital density matrix (n_{m,m'}^{\sigma}), also called occupation
          matrix (corresponding to eq 9 of ref [4]  and eq 1 of ref [2], see also
           [5] and variable [[dmatpuopt]]) is also
           given for each atom in the basis of real spherical harmonics.
           It is given at each SCF step in the log file: one can thus check the
           convergency of the calculation.

         <p> Consistency between total energy and forces in DFT+U have been checked.
