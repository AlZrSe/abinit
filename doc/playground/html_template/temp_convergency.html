<p> The convergency of the energy must be tested towards the plane wave convergency and the k-point convergency according to tolerance criteria. The convergency of the Self-Consistent cycle is governed by the way densities or potentials are mixed between each iteration.
<br/> The "accuracy" variable enables to tune the accuracy of a calculation by setting automatically up to seventeen variables.
<br/>At the level of the generation of electronic eigenfunctions, an efficient band-by-band preconditioned conjugate-gradient algorithm is used, in its non-self-consistent version. An alternative algorithm "lobpcg"
is also available.
<br/>
At the level of the self-consistency loop, an efficient
potential-based preconditioned conjugate-gradient algorithm is used.
Simple mixing is also available, as well as the Anderson algorithm.
Preconditioning of this algorithm is achieved through a model
dielectric function, or through an approximate dielectric matrix.
