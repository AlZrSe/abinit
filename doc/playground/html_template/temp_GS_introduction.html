<h3><b>1. Context</b></h3>

The computation of the ground state energy of an assembly of nuclei and electrons
placed in a repeated cell can be done using (1) plane waves and norm-conserving
pseudopotentials, or, (2) so-called
"Projector-Augmented Waves" (PAW method), with appropriate pseudoatomic data,
or (3) wavelets. The wavelet framework is described <a href="wavelets.html#here">here</a>.

<br/>In the plane wave framework, the program admits many different types of pseudopotentials.
There are several complete sets of norm-conserving pseudopotentials available for
most elements of the periodic table. The recommended one (GGA) comes from the ONCVPSP generator (with spin-orbit coupling).
For PAW calculation,the recommended one (GGA and LDA) is the JTH table in the PAW XML format. The choice between norm-conserving pseudopotentials or PAW is deduced automatically by the choice of the pseudopotential in the "files" file.

<h3><b>2. Input variable settings. </b></h3>

An input file must specify the following items:

<p>
- the <a href="general_settings.html#general">general settings</a> depending on the system under study
<br/>- the <a href="crystal.html#crystal">crystalline structure and symmetries</a>.
<br/>- the set of <a href="k_points.html#k_points">k_points</a> used.
<br/>- the <a href="xc.html#xc">exchange and correlation </a> functional.
<br/>- <a href="convergency.html#convergency">convergency settings </a>.
<br/>- possibly, <a href="PAW_settings.html#PAW_settings">PAW</a> special settings.
<br/>- possibly, input variables for <a href="polar_settings.html#polar_settings">spin-polarized systems and spin orbit coupling</a> calculations.
<br/>- possibly, <a href="other_settings.html#other_settings">other</a> special settings.

<h3><b>3. Tutorials and examples.</b></h3>
 <li><a href="../../tutorial/lesson_base1.html">The lesson 1</a> deals with the H2
  molecule : get the total energy, the electronic energies, the charge
  density, the bond length, the atomisation energy </li>
  <li><a href="../../tutorial/lesson_base2.html">The lesson 2</a> deals again with the H2
  molecule: convergence studies, LDA versus GGA </li>
  <li><a href="../../tutorial/lesson_base3.html">The lesson 3</a> deals with crystalline
  silicon (an insulator): the definition of a k-point grid, the smearing
  of the cut-off energy, the computation of a band structure, and again,
  convergence studies ...</li>
  <li><a href="../../tutorial/lesson_base4.html">The lesson 4</a> deals with crystalline
  aluminum (a metal), and its surface: occupation numbers, smearing the
  Fermi-Dirac distribution, the surface energy, and again, convergence
  studies ...</li>


<p>The reader can find many examples of input files in the directory /tests of the ABINIT package.

<p> An example of a minimal input file to calculate the ground state of crystalline aluminium is given here:
