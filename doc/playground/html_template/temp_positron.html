<p> The lifetime of positrons and their annihilation rate can be computed,
using the self-consistent two-component DFT, including force and stress computation,
LDA and GGA, norm-conserving as well as PAW.
Doppler broadening can also be computed.
The details of of the way to perform such calculations is given in the description of the <b>positron</b> input variable.
