__________________________________________________________________

A.  Warnings and important remarks

A.1 There has been some changes of names : 
     - input variable gwls_sternheimer_kmax has become gwls_stern_kmax;
     - input variable prt_effpot has become prt_model (multibinit);
     - input variable effmass has become erffmass_free;            
     - lesson tlda has become tdftu;

<TO BE UPDATED>
A.1 The Github ABINIT Web page, at https://github.com/abinit, allows one to
    access the mirror of the repository of ABINIT, as well as some other projects
    related to ABINIT, like AbiPy or the pseudo-dojo.

A.2 The content of the ABINIT Web portal, specifically for the pages related to the presentation of 
    ABINIT (https://www.abinit.org/about/what-is-abinit), has been upgraded.  
<END OF TO BE UPDATED>

B.  Most noticeable achievements

B.1 The documentation has been significantly upgraded by the introduction of "Topics", replacing the
    previous "lists of ABINIT features". All the capabilities of ABINIT are now presented in about 70 short topic Web pages.
    Each topic web page has a brief introduction, including references,
    then the web page lists the related tutorial lesson(s) -if any-, the related input variables (moreover, ordered
    according to their importance for the topics -compulsory, basic, useful or expert-),
    then possibly lists example input files, and ends with the bibliography list.
    By F. Jollet and X. Gonze

B.2 A central bibliography database abiref.bib has been created, and linked to the
    above-mentioned topics (B.1) but also to other parts of the ABINIT documentation (e.g. input variable list,
    the lessons of the tutorial, the theory documents, the acknowledgments ...).
    By X. Gonze
 
B.3 The list of input variables has been restructured, and is now searchable.
    The input variables for anaddb, aim and optic have been included in the database.
    By J. Bieder and X. Gonze

B.4 The frequency of usage of each input variable (in the set of automatic tests) is now automatically 
    computed, and mentioned in the documentation for this input variable. Examples input files are also mentioned in the documentation.
    The input files for the automatic tests can now be directly accessed on the Web, as well as the reference files for the lessons of the tutorial.
    By. X. Gonze

B.5 ABINIT is interfaced with Libxc 3.0, and the interface with Libxc 4.0 is in preparation.
    Tests libxc#06,07,17,18,20, 21 have been modified, because not all functionals ofr libxc v2.0 have been preserved in v3.0 (bug fixes).
    By M. Verstraete (to be checked)

B.6 A new lesson of the tutorial, called "Electron-positron annihilation" has been created.
    By J. Wiktor and M. Torrent.

B.7 The new input variable chkdilatmx has been introduced, to allow expert users to make
    ABINIT bypass the stopping criterion related to dilatmx. In practice, if the condition related 
    to dilatmx is not met, ABINIT continues, and delivers an (approximate) optimized geometry and energy,
    that might be used by external drivers like e.g. USPEX to continue the search for global optimized structures.
    See input variable chkdilatmx, and test v3#42 .
    By X. Gonze
    
    


<TO BE UPDATED>
B.1 Implementation of algorithms to interpolate the electronic band structure,
    based either on "star functions" of on "B-splines" (as alternatives to Wannier function interpolation).
    See the input variables einterp, nkpath, and prtebands, and tests Tlibxc#42, Tv8#04.
    Work by M. Giantomassi

B.2 The Fock mixing factor for the HSE hybrid functional can be tuned thanks to the input variable gwfockmix  .
    (Warning : this is for the GW-type approach to electronic structure only, not for total energies)
    See test Tlibxc#43 .
    Work by W. Chen.

B.3 Implementation of spatially-varying chemical potential, for each atomic species.
    See the input variables chempot and nzchempot, and tests Tv8#30 and 31.
    Work by X. Gonze

B.4 Linear geometrical constraints can now be imposed on PIMD runs.
    This allows ABINIT to use the blue moon sampling technique.
    See the input variable pimd_contraint, and test Tv8#05
    The use of history (HIST) files is now possible with images.
    Work by G. Geneste and M. Torrent.

B.5 Computation of linear reponse (optics executable as well as BSE part of ABINIT)
    in the case of temperature-dependent electronic structure.
    See tests Tv67mbpt#50-53.
    WARNING : This capability of ABINIT has not been fully tested. However, the
    basic tests for non-spin-polarized simple semiconductors are OK.
    As usual, use at your own risk.
    Work by Y. Gillet and M. Giantomassi.

B.6 Computation of Gruneisen parameters by finite differences, within ANADDB.
    See test v8#45
    Work by M. Giantomassi

B.7 New LOBPCG implementation wfoptalg=114.
    This is the default when paral_kgb=1.
    Performances are equivalent in standard use (MPI alone) and much better with openmp+multithreaded linalg. 
    It also allows to have only one block for large system and to reduce memory copies.
    This version has been developed keeping in mind the next generation of HPC.
    Work by J. Bieder

B.8 New algorithms for the displacement of nuclei (ionmov) :
    - Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) predictor (ionmov=25)
    - Velocity Verlet (VV) NVE molecular dynamics predictor (ionmov=24)
    See Tv8#12 for ionmov=24. 
    Work by S. Prokhorenko

B.9 Refactoring of ANADDB for the production of DOS and other thermodynamic quantities,
    also the mean square displacement and mean square velocity.
    The DOS is obtained using usual DOS methods, instead of the histogram method,
    and converges much faster with ng2qpt. Activated with prtdos 1 or 2 in anaddb.
    Work by M. Verstraete.

C. Changes for the developers (also compilers)

<TO BE UPDATED> 
C.1 Management of the test farm : the new bot ubu_intel_17_openmpi 
    has been activated, so that Intel 17 is now supported.
    Also, replacement of shiva_gnu_6.3_py3k by inca_gnu_6.3_py3k,
    update of graphene (MacPorts) to gcc6.3 + scalapack.
    By J.M. Beuken.
<END OF TO BE UPDATED>

D.  Other changes
(or on-going developments, not yet finalized).

D.1 The "Adaptively Compressed Operator" approach for the fast application of the Fock operator has been implemented,
    and replaces the traditional way to apply the Fock operator in hybrid functionals (e.g. HSE06, PBE0, ...).
    These are not yet to be considered in production, though. Likely for ABINITv8.8.  
    See tests libxc 51, 52, 53, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71.
    By F. Jollet and X. Gonze

D.2 A set of 6 input files and accompanying references (from 32 to 2048 procs), for benchmarking high-performance computing
    is available in the new directory ~abinit/tests/hpc .
    Not yet tested automatically, but this future capability is prepared.
    By M. Torrent.

D.3 The tutorial on the temperature-dependent electronic structure has been imported from the ABINIT wiki to the
    usual location ~abinit/doc/tutorial . However, it is not yet operational.
    Work is also going on on tutorial fold2bloch.
    By X. Gonze


D.10 Change of names : 
     - input variable gwls_sternheimer_kmax has become gwls_stern_kmax;
     - input variable prt_effpot has become prt_model (multibinit); 
     - input variable effmass has become erffmass_free; 
     - lesson tlda has become tdftu;
     

<TO BE UPDATED>
D.1 The printing of potentials (e.g. prtvxc ...) works now for DFPT.
    By M. Verstraete.

D.2 New input variable prtphbands.
    See tests v7#88 and v8#46.
    By M. Giantomassi

D.3 In case the ANADDB interpolation of phonon frequencies produces
    erroneously a negative slope around gamma, the new nsphere=-1 possibility
    allows ANADDB to select a set of IFCs that does not lead to such non-physical behaviour.
    See test v8#46.
    Work by M. Giantomassi.

D.4 Added new value for nlflag=3 that computes only the non-linear susceptibility.
    By F. Naccarato.

D.5 Computation of forces is now possible in the Wavelets + PAW case.
    By M. Torrent.

    related computations (including zero-point renormalisation). 
    See new tests v8#41 to 44.
    Work by M. Giantomassi.

D.7 Ongoing work : Raman intensities, in the PAW case, using DFPT. 
    By L. Baguet and M. Torrent

D.8 Ongoing work related to non-collinear DFPT.
    Definition of the new input variable rfmagn, as well as Tv8#20 .
    DFPT with static B-field (Zeeman term only) works for q=(0 0 0).
    Adjustmanet of dfpt corrections for metals to non-collinear case.
    Bug fix for GS calculations with finite magnetic field (case of collinear spins).
    By S. Prokhorenko, F. Ricci, and E. Bousquet

D.9 Ongoing work on the multibinit project.
    NPT simulations are possible.
    New tests v8#06 and paral#100, to check the correct IO of XML files.
    Note that tests Tv7#120-124 have been renumbered Tv8#07-11.
    Work by A. Martin
