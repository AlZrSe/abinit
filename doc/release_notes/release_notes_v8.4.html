Version 8.4, released on May 24, 2017.

Changes with respect to version 8.2 :

A. WARNINGS.
B. Most noticeable achievements (for users)
C. Changes in the package, for developers
D. Other changes (or on-going developments, not finalized)

<TO BE UPDATED>

A.  WARNINGS AND IMPORTANT REMARKS

A.1 The Github ABINIT Web page, at https://github.com/abinit, allows one to
    access the mirror of the repository of ABINIT, as well as some other projects
    related to ABINIT, like AbiPy or the pseudo-dojo.

A.2 The content of the ABINIT Web portal, specifically for new users, has been upgraded. 
    In particular, the description of the electronic support (Github, forum, portal ...) is
    basically up-to-date.

__________________________________________________________________

B.  Most noticeable achievements

B.1 Implementation of algorithms to interpolate the electronic band structure,
    based either on "star functions" of on "B-splines" (as alternatives to Wannier function
    interpolation).
    See the input variables einterp, nkpath, and prtebands, and tests Tlibxc#42, Tv8#04.
    Work by M. Giantomassi

B.2 The Fock mixing factor for the HSE hybrid functional can be tuned thanks to the input variable gwfockmix  .
    (Electronic structure only, not total energies)
    See test Tlibxc#43 .
    Work by F. Bruneval

B.3 Implementation of spatially-varying chemical potential, for each atomic species.
    See the input variables chempot and nzchempot, and tests Tv8#31 and 31.
    Work by X. Gonze

B.4 Linear geometrical constraints can now be imposed on PIMD runs.
    This allows ABINIT to use the blue moon sampling technique.
    See the input variable pimd_contraint, and test Tv8#05
    Work by G. Geneste

B.5 Computation of linear reponse (optics executable as well as BSE part of ABINIT)
    in the case of temperature-dependent electronic structure.
    See tests Tv67mbpt#50-53.
    WARNING : This capability of ABINIT has not been fully tested. However, the
    basic tests for non-spin-polarized simple semiconductors are OK.
    As usual, use at your own risk.
    Work by Y. Gillet and M. Giantomassi.

B.6 Computation of Gruneisen parameters by finite differences, within ANADDB.
    See test v8#45
    Work by M. Giantomassi
__________________________________________________________________

C. Changes for the developers (also compilers)

   (no such items for v8.4)
__________________________________________________________________

D.  Other changes
(or on-going developments, not yet finalized).

D.1 New input variable prtphbands.
    See tests v7#88 and v8#46.
    By M. Giantomassi

D.2 In case the ANADDB interpolation of phonon frequencies produces
    erroneously a negative slope around gamma, the new nsphere=-1 possibility
    allows to select a set of IFCs that does not lead to such non-physical behaviour.
    See test v8#46.
    Work by M. Giantomassi.

D.3 Ongoing work concerning the new "driver" optdrive=7 specifically dealing with electron-phonon 
    related computations (including zero-point renormalisation). 
    See tests v8#41 to 44.
    Work by M. Giantomassi.

D.4 Ongoing work : Raman intensities, in the PAW case, using DFPT. 
    By L. Baguet and M. Torrent

D.5 Ongoing work related to non-collinear DFPT.
    Definition of the new input variable rfmagn, as well as Tv8#20 .
    By F. Ricci, S. Prokhorenko, and E. Bousquet

D.6 Ongoing work on the multibinit project.
    New tests v8#06 and paral#100, to check the correct IO of XML files.
    Note that tests Tv7#120-124 have been renumbered Tv8#07-11.
    Work by A. Martin

D.7 New test paral#62, to make sure paralkgb=0 works when there are some idle procs.
    By M. Giantomassi

D.8 Ongoing work on forces and stresses for hybrid functionals.
    By F. Jollet 

D.9 Ongoing work on the electron-phonon postprocessor.
    By G. Antonius.

D.18 Numerous miscellaneous additional bug fixes 
     (to the sources, as well as to the build system, including patches for the fallbacks), 
     and improvements of documentation by :
     G. Antonius, L. Baguet, J. Bieder, F. Bruneval,
     M. Giantomassi, Y. Gillet, G. Petretto, Y. Pouillon,
     M. Verstraete, M. Torrent (in particular, for DFPT+PAW).
