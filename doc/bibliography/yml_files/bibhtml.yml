      This file provides a description of suggested acknowledgments and references to be inserted in scientific papers 
      whose results have been obtained thanks to ABINIT. It discusses also briefly the problem of co-authorship.

      <h3><b><a name="a"></a>A. Introduction</b></h3>
 
      In the section <a href="acknowledgments.html#b">B. List of suggestions</a>, you will find
      several references we suggest you to cite in your papers that have benefited from ABINIT.
      However, we wish first to clarify the spirit in which the present document (Acknowledgments) has
      been written. The users of the code have no formal obligations
      with respect to the ABINIT group (within the limits of the GNU General
      Public License). However, it is common practice
      in the scientific literature, to acknowledge the efforts of people
      that have made the research possible.
      <p>Please note the following :
      <ul>
      <li>1) The ABINIT project, in order to be viable, should be known
        as a robust tool, that has been tested, and that has allowed
        good scientific research. This will be
        facilitated if the ABINIT project is mentioned properly in research papers.
      <li>2) Some recent ideas and algorithms are coded, and it would be fair to cite these.
      <li>3) You might also register on the <a href="https://forum.abinit.org">ABINIT forum</a>.
        Indirectly, this also helps the ABINIT developer group, because
        the total number of registered people on the ABINIT forum
        is often cited as an indicator of the user community size.
      </ul>
      In agreement with the GNU General Public License, there
      is no request for co-authorship of articles whose scientific results
      have been obtained thanks to ABINIT, by any ABINIT developer.
      This applies even for recently implemented features, as their
      availability in a public version is governed by the GNU GPL license.
      If you think your work could benefit from collaboration with
      ABINIT developers, you can contact the ABINIT group
      for a possible arrangement, in which case co-authorship should be discussed.
      (Of course, the ABINIT developpers also have the right
      to decline giving assistance to users ...).

      <h3><b><a name="b"></a>B. List of suggestions</b></h3>

      First, an overview ...
      <p>
      The first general ABINIT paper, Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#1">1</a>],
      in the list of suggestions below, should be cited
      in papers that have benefited from the ABINIT project, irrespective of their content.
      There are three other ABINIT papers,
      Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#2">2</a>],
      [<a href="acknowledgments.html#3">3</a>],[<a href="acknowledgments.html#4">4</a>],
      that might as well be considered,
      irrespective of the content of the paper, because these papers are quite general as well,
      although they are older (2009, 2005 and 2002).
      <br>
      There are also many articles that are more focused: they describe some specific capability of ABINIT.
      The following list is actually not complete ... More references will be proposed by ABINIT itself (see the end of the output file),
      in the files explaining <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/allvariables.html">the input variables</a>,
      in the <a href="../topics/html_automatically_generated/all_topics.html">"topics" files</a>,
      as well as in the references of the four general papers ...
      <br>
      Use of PAW should refer to Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#6">6</a>].
      Self-consistent GW should be acknowledged by citing Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#14">14</a>].
      Massive parallelism (coupled band / FFT) should refer to Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#16">16</a>].
      Use of the phonon or electric field response features of ABINIT should be acknowledged by citing
      Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#8">8</a>] and Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#9">9</a>]
      (and Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#13">13</a>] for thermodynamical properties),
      while the response to strain should be acknowledged by citing
      Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#10">10</a>].
      Computation of non-linear properties (e.g. Raman scattering) should be acknowledged by citing
      Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#12">12</a>].
      When pseudopotentials were generated thanks to the ONCVPSP code, Ref.
      [<a href="acknowledgments.html#22">22</a>] is suggested.
      Computations using the Van der Waals DFT-D functional (Grimme) should be acknowledged by citing
      Ref.[<a href="acknowledgments.html#23">23</a>].
