# This file provides the information needed to generate the documentation files that describes the bibliography
# Each paragraph of such documentation file has a mix of formatting html information and real content.

# The present file contains the html information.
# The "default" html information is presented in the section "default", at the bottom of the file. 
# For most of the var*.html files, the default html formatting is hardly changed, so only minimal information
# is needed to generate them. For the "special" parameters and for the list of all input variables,
# some minor adjustments are needed, so that the default list # is less adequate.
