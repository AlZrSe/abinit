    introduction : |- 
         <p> The use of wavelets (instead of plane waves) is available in ABINIT.
         At present, it works for the SCF cycles : one can get density, total energy
         and forces, in some basic cases (HGH or GTH pseudopotentials only, or PAW - in v7.2).
         Available also : the finite size corrections to the
         total energy, restart on wavefunctions following the ETSF norm and geometry
         relaxation using BFGS. Molecular dynamic is also available for
         test purposes.
