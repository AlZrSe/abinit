intro : |
  <p>This lesson aims at showing how to get the following physical
  properties:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The zero-point-motion renormalization (ZPR) of eigenenergies<br> </li>
    <li>The temperature-dependence of eigenenergies<br> </li>
    <li>The lifetime/broadening of eigenenergies<br> </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  For the theory related to the temperature-dependent calculations, you can read the following papers:  
  [[Ponce2015]], [[Ponce2014]] and [[Ponce2014a]].
  <p>
  There are two ways to compute the temperature dependence with Abinit:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Using Anaddb</b>: historically the first coded way. This option does not require the use of Netcdf.</li>
    <li><b>Using post-processing python scripts</b>:
      this is the recommended way as it provide more options and is more optimal (take less disk space and is less memory demanding). 
      This option REQUIRES the use of Netcdf (both for Abinit and for python). 
  </ul>
