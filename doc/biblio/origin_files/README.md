Abinit bibliography
===================

X. Gonze

The ABINIT bibliography is contained in the bibtex file `abiref.bib`.

## Generating the new html

In the ~abinit/doc directory, run:

    python generate_doc.py

The new html files will be updated in ~abinit/doc/biblio/generated_files .
Do not modify files in the latter directory. It is useless since they are automatically generated.
