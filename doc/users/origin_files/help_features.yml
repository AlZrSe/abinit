intro : |
  This document gives an overview of the features implemented in the ABINIT package,
  grouped in different topics, for the beginner as well as more experienced user. 
  It might answer the question "How to ... with ABINIT ?", to some extent.
  <br>It also gives a synthetic view on the needed settings.

## Now come the different sections, numbered.

## Each section must have a title, that will form the table of content.
## This table of content is automatically generated. A tag is also requested, to allow easier maintenance of external links.
## Note the small (one space) indentation for the title and body keys.
sec1:
 title: "Foreword"
 tag: foreword
 body: |
  <p> Documenting the features of a large scientific code is a complex task. The present list of features
  refers to different "topics". Each topic has a dedicated page, which should be quick to read,
  unlike the [[lesson:welcome|lessons of the tutorial]], each of which is usually at least one hour work. 
  Many of the topics make the link between a physical property or quantity 
  (including bibliographical references for the theory, and sometimes pointing to published work using this feature)
  and the way it is to be computed with ABINIT (e.g. corresponding input variable, example input files, and possibly tutorial(s)).

  <p> This "topic"-based approach might be used by the beginner to get a broad overview of the capabilities of ABINIT 
  as well as to the more expert user to quickly find the way to compute some existing quantity, or to 
  remember which input variable is useful or mandatory for the calculation of a given property.
  Some topics are rather "input"-oriented (e.g. how to specify the atomic geometry, the occupation numbers, etc),
  other are more "property"-oriented (e.g. how to compute the elastic constants, the temperature-dependence of the electronic structure, etc),
  other are related to proper/better usage of the code. 

  <p> Care is taken not to duplicate existing more complete documentation in ABINIT, but to point to it if appropriate.
  Not all the ABINIT documentation is covered by the Web-accessible documents, there are still a few unlinked documents 
  in the subdirectories of ~abinit/doc (work is in progress to make it all available). 
  Discussions on the [[https://forum.abinit.org|ABINIT forum]] might also allow to get information.

 title: "ABINIT specifications for static DFT calculations"
 tag: atoms
 body: |
  The topic [[topic:GSintroduction|Building an input file]] briefly explains the content of an ABINIT input file.
  The following topics go more into the details, however restricting to static DFT calclations. Going beyond these is left 
  for other sections ([[help:features#3|Sec. 3]] and beyond)
