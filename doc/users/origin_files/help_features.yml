  <h3><b>1. Introduction</b></h3>
  
  
   <p> ABINIT is a package whose main program allows
  to find the total energy, charge density and electronic structure
  of systems made of electrons and nuclei (molecules and periodic solids)
  within Density Functional Theory,
  using pseudopotentials and a planewave basis, or
  augmented plane waves, or even wavelets.
  Some possibilities of ABINIT go beyond Density Functional Theory, i.e. the
  many-body perturbation theory (GW approximation) and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory.
  
  ABINIT also includes options to optimize the geometry
  according to the DFT forces and stresses, or to perform molecular dynamics
  simulation using these forces, or to generate
  dynamical (vibrations - phonons) properties, dielectric properties,
  mechanical properties, thermodynamical properties, etc .
  In addition to the main ABINIT code,
  different utility programs are provided.
   <p> The simplest sort of job computes an electronic structure for a fixed set
  of atomic positions within a periodic unit cell.  By electronic structure , we
  mean a set of eigenvalues and wavefunctions which achieve the lowest (DFT)
  energy possible for that basis set (that number of planewaves).  The code
  takes the description of the unit cell and atomic positions and assembles
  a crystal potential from the input atomic pseudopotentials, then uses
  either an input wavefunction or simple gaussians to generate the
  initial charge density and screening potential, then uses a self-consistent
  algorithm to iteratively adjust the planewave coefficients
  until a sufficient convergence is reached in the energy.
   <p> Analytic derivatives of the energy with respect to atomic positions and
  unit cell primitive translations yield atomic forces and the stress tensor.
  The code can optionally adjust atomic positions to move the forces toward
  zero and adjust unit cell parameters to move toward zero stress.
  It can performs molecular dynamics. It can also be used to find responses
  to atomic displacements and homogeneous electric field, so that
  the full phonon band structure can be constructed...
