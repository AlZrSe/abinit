<h1>Help file for the Anaddb utility of the ABINIT package.</h1>

<h2>This file explains the use and i/o parameters needed for the "Analysis of Derivative DataBase" code of the ABINIT package.</h2>
<hr>
<a name="top"></a>
<p>This code is able to compute interatomic force constants,
but also, more generally, many different physical properties
from databases containing derivatives of the total energy
(Derivative DataBases - DDB).
<br>
The user is not supposed to know how the Derivative
DataBase (DBB) has been generated. He/she should simply know what
material is described by the DDB he/she wants to use.
<br>
If he/she is interested in the generation of DDB, and wants to know more about this
topic, he/she will read different help files of the ABINIT package, related to the
<a href="../../users/generated_files/help_abinit.html#">main ABINIT executable</a>, to the
[[help:respfn|response-function features of ABINIT]],
to the <a href="../../users/generated_files/help_mrgddb.html#">DDB merge tool</a>.
</h3>

<p> 
It will be easier to discover the
present file with the help of the tutorial (<a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_welcome.html#">lesson_welcome</a>), especially
the lesson on response functions (<a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_rf2.html#">lesson_rf2</a>).
<br>It is worthwhile to print this help file, for ease of reading.

<p>

In short, a Derivative DataBase contains a list of derivatives
of the total energy with respect to three kind of perturbations:
phonons, electric field and stresses. The present code analyses
the DDB, and directly gives properties of the material under
investigation, like phonon spectrum, frequency-dependent dielectric tensor, thermal properties.

<p>
Given an input file (parameters described below),
the user must create a "files" file which lists names for the files
the job will require, including the main input file, the main output file,
the name of the DDB, and some other file names optionally used for selected capabilities of the code.

<p>The files file (called for example ab.files) could look like: </p>
<p>
</p>
<pre>  anaddb.in<br>  anaddb.out<br>  ddb<br>  band_eps<br>  gkk<br>  anaddb.ep<br>  ddk<br> </pre>
<p>In this example:<br>
  <ul>
  <li> the main input file is called "anaddb.in", <br></li>
  <li> the main output will be put into the file called "anaddb.out", <br></li>
  <li> the input DDB file is called "ddb", <br></li>
  <li> information to draw phonon band structures will go to band_eps<br></li>
  <li> the input GKK file is called "gkk" (used only for electron-phonon interactions)<br></li>
  <li> the base filename for electron-phonon output "anaddb.ep" (used only for electron-phonon interactions)<br></li>
  <li> the file name for ddk reference files: these are the GKK files generated in k-point derivative runs, using the <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/files.html#prtgkk">prtgkk</a> abinit input variable (used only for electron-phonon transport calculations)</li>
  </ul>
  Other examples are given in the ~abinit/test/v2 directory. The latter three filename information
  is often not used by anaddb.
  The maximal length of names for the main input or output files is presently 264 characters.

  <p>The main executable file is called anaddb.
    Supposing that the "files" file is called anaddb.files,
    and that the executable is placed in your working directory, anaddb is run
    interactively (in Unix) with the command
  <ul>
    <li><i>anaddb < anaddb.files >& log </i></li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  or, in the background, with the command
 <ul>
  <li><i>anaddb < anaddb.files >& log & </i></li>
 </ul>
<p> where standard out and standard error are piped
to the log file called "log"
(piping the standard error, thanks to the '&' sign placed after '>'
is <b>really important</b> for the analysis of eventual failures, when not due
to ABINIT, but to other sources, like disk full problem ...).
The user can specify any names he/she wishes for any of these files.
Variations of the above commands could be needed,
depending on the flavor of UNIX that is used on the platform
that is considered for running the code.
</p>
<p>The syntax of the input file is strictly similar to the syntax of
the main abinit input files: the file is parsed, keywords are identified,
comments are also identified. However, the multidataset mode is not available.
</p>

<h3><b><a name="2"></a>2. Input variables </b></h3>



<p>
This ANADDB utility is able to perform many different tasks, each governed by a
selected set of input variables, with also some input variables common to many of the
different tasks. 
<li> <a href="../../topics/generated_files/topic_anaddbCommon.html"> anaddb common input variables</a></li>
<li> <a href="../../topics/generated_files/topic_anaddbSpec.html"> anaddb tasks</a></li>
<li> <a href="../../topics/generated_files/topic_anaddbEPC.html"> anaddb electron-phonon input variables</a> </li>


<p>
<p>The list of input variables for the anaddb input file are presented in <a href="#">[[FAKE LINK:varanaddb]]</a>. In order
to discover them, it is easier to use the different lessons of the tutorial:
start with the second lesson on response functions (<a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_rf2.html#">lesson_rf2</a>),
then follow the lesson on elasticity and piezoelectricity (<a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_elastic.html#">lesson_elastic</a>),
the lesson on electron-phonon interaction (<a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_eph.html#">lesson_eph</a>), and
the lesson on non-linear properties (<a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_nlo.html#">lesson_nlo</a>).
