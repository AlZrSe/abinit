The Fock exchange term has been implemented in ABINIT, both in the norm-conserving pseudopotential framework and in the PAW one. Some details about the implementation in ABINIT can be found <a href="../documents/hf-2017.pdf">here</a>.
<br/> For an ABINIT user, to make a calculation of Fock exchange:
<br/>- do a first GGA dataset for the ground state
<br/>- do a second dataset for the Fock calculation choosing ixc=40-42 (HF, PBE0, PBE0-1/3), -406 (PBE0-Libxc), -456 (PBE0-1/3 Libxc), or -427, -428 (HSE03, HSE06).
<p>
<br/>The energy and forces are available in the norm-conserving and PAW frameworks. Stresses are available in the norm-conserving framework only for the moment.
<p> WARNING:
<br/> Forces and stresses cannot be calculated simultaneously for the moment.
<br/> The spin polarised case has not been extensively tested for the moment.
<br/> Use istwfk=1, iscf=2, paral_kgb=0, paral_atom=0.
<br/> The efficiency of the calculation is not optimal. Work is in progress concerning this point.
