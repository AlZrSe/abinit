<p> The use of wavelets (instead of plane waves) is available in ABINIT.
At present, it works for the SCF cycles : one can get density, total energy
and forces, in some basic cases (HGH or GTH pseudopotentials only, or PAW - in v7.2).
Available also : the finite size corrections to the
total energy, restart on wavefunctions following the ETSF norm and geometry
relaxation using BFGS. Molecular dynamic is also available for
test purposes.
