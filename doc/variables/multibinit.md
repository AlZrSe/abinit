Flag to activate the bound process:

* 0 --> Do not activate the bound process 

* 1 --> This option will generate all the possible combinaisons of coefficients from 1 to [[multibinit:bound_maxCoeff]]. Some constrains are imposed during the generation and the fit of the coefficients, they have to be positive and with even power.
