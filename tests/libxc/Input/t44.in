#%%   Diamond: G0W0 @ scHSE06 calculation. Monitor the direct gap at Gamma.
#%%   First, with the scGW methodology based on a Kohn-Sham basis, 
#%%   then doing the scHSE06 as stand-alone, followed by a one-shot G0W0.
#%%   At the HSE06 level, the scGW methodology delivers 7.365 eV,
#%%   while the stand-aline methodology delivers 7.387 eV.
#%%   This difference can be significantly decreased by raising nband from 14 to 30,
#%%   by increasing ecut (and ecutwf) from 11.5 Ha to 20 Ha,
#%%   and increasing ecutsigx from 11.5 Ha to 40 Ha,
#%%   Giving 7.339 eV from the scGW methodology, and 7.341 eV from the stand-alone scHSE06.
