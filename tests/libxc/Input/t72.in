#%%   2x2x2 with 4 shifts for the k point grid in the FBZ
#%%   1x1x1 with 4 shifts for the k point grid for the Fock operator in the FBZ
#%%   Tests were performed with a k-point grid 16x16x16 (without additional shift),
#%%   to try to recover the nice behaviour of the HSE03 with down sampling 
#%%   shown in Marsman et al JPCM 20, 064201 (2008), Fig. 1 (there, the reference was 24x24x24)
#%%   Unfortunately, the same behaviour as for PBE0 was observed ?!
